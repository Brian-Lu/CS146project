      The term pop was defined in the the mid-1950s to describe a new genre of music that specifically dealt with "non-classical" music. For a time, the term pop was used interchangeably with rock, as artists and bands like Elvis, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones all defined the pop & rock genres

        In the late 1960's, the terms pop and rock began to go in different directions. While rock pursued new trends in music and tested possibilities of sound, pop became a genre defined by commercial success and appeased the masses. Pop music was meant to appeal to everyone, and it has stayed that way since the 1960's.

      The 1970s saw pop's rock roots play out, but in a much softer fashion. Bands like The Eagles and artist Bob Dylan carved out a unique sound that combined rock and country elements to create a softer sound than the rock and hard rock of the 1970s decade. Other acts such as Hall & Oates, the Jackson 5, Elvis Presley, and Eric Clapton combined elements of many genres to give the 1970s a diversified pop sound.

        The 1980s saw a stark departure from the rock sound of the previous decade and embraced new wave and dance culture as a defining aspect of pop music. Soft rock became very popular, along with synth-pop. The 1980s was the first decade to use digital recordings, encorporating elements of synthesisers and non-traditional instruments. Acts such as Michael Jackson, Prince, madonna, and Whitney Houston all became superstars during this decade, seeing commercial success that was never even accessible before the decade.

        Many acts have rise and fell throughout the decades since the 1980s. In the 1990s, hip-hop and alternative rock influenced pop, but the 2000s saw the rise of R&B influenced hits such as Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. The 2010s have seen a resurgence in dance music and eletric hits. Taylor Swift, Rihanna, and Justin Beiber all are major acts of the decade.
