    <h1>History of Electronic Music</h1>
	<p>
		Electronic music technology was first pioneered by American, European, and Japanese scientists in the 1960s. 
		This time marked the dawn of algorithmic composition by computers. 
		After the initial exploration of music production by electronics, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. 
		This standard was named the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI).
	</p>
	<p>
		The proliferation of personal computers and the <a href="../../vocab/index.html#midi">MIDI</a> interface beginning in the 1980s brought about the first popular genre of electronic music, known loosely as chip music or bitpop. 
		Bitpop was produced using 8-bit devices and was commonly heard in Atari and Nintendo video games. 
		Today, electronic music is produced from a wide variety of sound resources. 
		It is developed with the help of computer software, advanced keyboards, sound effects, and added human vocals.

		Contemporary electronic music is influenced by disco and funk from the 1970s. 
		In the 1980s, European groups like Eiffel 65 from Italy and German duo La Bouche debuted with electronic music styles.

		However, electronic music became more prevalent in the popular domain in the 1990s and early 2000s, because of increased affordability of equipment. 
		By then, electronic music had been incorporated into popular music and had become a genre of its own. 
		Commercially successful artists from the 1990s include Haddaway, Robin S., and Corona. 
		Some successful electronic artists from the early 2000s are Darude, The Chemical Brothers, and Paul van Dyk.

		Today, electronic music is often fused with other genres to create subgenres.
		Some subgenres of electronic music are <a href="../../vocab/index.html#edm">EDM</a>, <a href="../../vocab/index.html#house">house</a>, tropical house, <a href="../../vocab/index.html#dubstep">dubstep</a>, <a href="../../vocab/index.html#trance">trance</a>, and hardcore.
