            Musically, the sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar which is typically supported by an electric bass guitar and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals. This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments, particularly keyboards such as the piano, Hammond organ and synthesizers.
