        <h2><a name = "1950">The 1950's</a></h2>
        The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time, including rhythm and blues and gospel music, with country and western. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The first use of the term in print was in The Village Voice, by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop. 

        <h2><a name = "1960">The Early 1960's</a></h2>
        <h3> <a name = "Pop and instrument">Pop rock and instrumental rock</a></h3>
            The term pop has been used since the early 20th century to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pop rock and Instrumental rock placed an emphasis on artistic values and "authenticity", stressed live performance and instrumental or vocal virtuosity and was often seen as encapsulating progressive developments rather than simply reflecting existing trends.
        <h3><a name = "Surf">Surf music</a></h3>
            The instrumental rock and roll of performers such as Duane Eddy, Link Wray and the Ventures was developed by Dick Dale, who added distinctive "wet" reverb, rapid alternate picking, and Middle Eastern and Mexican influences. He produced the regional hit "Let's Go Trippin'" in 1961 and launched the surf music craze.
            <br>
            <br>
            Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music, particularly the work of the Beach Boys.
        <h3><a name = "British">British Invasion</a></h3>
            By the end of 1962, what would become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like the Beatles, Gerry & the Pacemakers and the Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers, Herman's Hermits and the Hollies from Manchester.
            <br>
            <br>
            The British Invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll, opening the door for subsequent British (and Irish) performers to achieve international success.
            <br>
            <br>
            The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music, and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters.
        <h2><a name = "Psych">Psychedelia and progressivism</a></h2>
        <h3><a name = "Blues and folk">Blues and folk fusions</a></h3>
            Although the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American blues, including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.
            <br>
            <br>
            British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as Lead Belly and Robert Johnson. Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound, often centered on the electric guitar, based on the Chicago blues, particularly after the tour of Britain by Muddy Waters in 1958.
            <br>
            <br>
            By the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival had grown to a major movement, utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments.
            <br>
            <br>
            Early attempts to combine elements of folk and rock included the Animals' "House of the Rising Sun" (1964), which was the first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation.
        <h3><a name = "Psychedelic rock">Psychedelic rock</a></h3>
            Psychedelic music's LSD-inspired vibe began in the folk scene.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Beatles introduced many of the major elements of the psychedelic sound to audiences in this period, such as guitar feedback, the Indian sitar and backmasking sound effects.
            <br>
            <br>
            Psychedelic rock reached its peak in the last years of the decade.
        <h3><a name = "Progressive">Progressive rock</a></h3>
            Progressive rock, a term sometimes used interchangeably with art rock, moved beyond established musical formulas by experimenting with different instruments, song types, and forms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy and science fiction.
        <h3><a name = "Jazz">Jazz rock</a></h3>
            In the late 1960s jazz rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues rock, psychedelic and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz.
        <h2><a name = "1970">The Early 1970's</a></h2>
        <h3><a name = "Glam">Glam Rock</a></h3>
            Glam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of and reaction against those trends.
            <br>
            <br>
            Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics.
        <h3><a name = "soft hard heavy metal">Soft rock, hard rock and early heavy metal</a></h3>
            Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.
            <br>
            <br>
            In contrast, hard rock was more often derived from blues-rock and was played louder and with more intensity.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the late 1960s the term "heavy metal" began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity.
        <h2><a name = "Punk">The Punk era</a></h2>
        <h3><a name = "punk rock">Punk Rock</a></h3>
            Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom.
            <br>
            <br>
            They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. 
        <h3><a name = "post punk">Post-punk</a></h3>
        Post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 1980s as punk's more artistic and challenging side.
        <h2><a name = "2000">2000s-present</a></h2>
        <h3><a name = "emo">Post-hardcore and emo</a></h3>
        Post-hardcore developed in the US, particularly in the Chicago and Washington, DC areas, in the early to mid-1980s, with bands that were inspired by the do-it-yourself ethics and guitar-heavy music of hardcore punk, but influenced by post-punk, adopting longer song formats, more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Emo also emerged from the hardcore scene in 1980s Washington, D.C., initially as "emocore", used as a term to describe bands who favored expressive vocals over the more common abrasive, barking style.
        <h3><a name = "Digital electronic rock">Digital electronic rock</a></h3>
        In the 2000s, as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer.
        <br>
        <br>
        This created new forms of performance such as laptronica and live coding.
        <br>
        <br>
        These techniques also began to be used by existing bands and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds, including indie electronic, electroclash, dance-punk and new rave.
