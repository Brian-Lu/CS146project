            The earliest written secular music dates from the 12th century troubadours (in the form of virelais, estampies, ballades, etc.), but most notated manuscripts emanate from places of learning usually connected with the church, and therefore inevitably have a religious basis.
            Gregorian chant and plainsong which are monodic gradually developed during the 11th to 13th centuries into organum. Organum was, however, initially rather stifled by rigid rules governing melody and rhythm, which led ultimately to the so-called Ars Nova period of the 14th century, principally represented by the composers de Vitry, Machaut, and Landini.

        <h2><a name = "Renaissance">Renaissance (c.1400 - c.1600)</a></h2>
            <p>Composers stuck mostly to choral writing here is obvious new delight in textural variety and contrast, so that, for example, a particular section of text might be enhanced by a vocal part dropping out momentarily, only to return again at a special moment of emphasis. The four most influential composers of the fifteenth century were Dunstable, Ockeghem, Despres and Dufay.
 
            In the second half of the 16th century was the beginnings of what many associate with the normal feel of 'classical' music. Composers diverged from the modal system of harmony towards the organisation of their work into major and minor scales, creating the strong sensation of each piece having a definite tonal centre or 'key'. Instrumental music came into its own for the first time, especially keyboard music in the form of fantasias, variations, and dance movements (galliards, pavanes etc.). Some composers of particular note are:  Dowland, Tallis, Byrd, Gibbons, Frescobaldi, Palestrina, Victoria, Lassus, Alonso Lobo, Duarte Lobo, Cardoso and Gesualdo.

            During the Baroque period was the period of the modern orchestra, along with opera, the concerto, sonata, and modern cantata. The Renaissance’s voil family was replaced by violin, viola and cello. The harpsichord was also invented
 
            From the beginning of the 18th century the modern harmonic system based upon the major and minor scales was effectively pan-European. Choral music was no longer the dominant form.  Composers turned more and more to writing idiomatic instrumental works for ensembles of variety, so 'classical' music became more popular in society
 
            Some popular composers of the time were: Monteverdi, Corelli, Alessandro Scarlatti, Schutz, Buxtehude,Purcell and Lully. The very most popular composers, that defined the Baroque period, were: Johann Sebastian Bach, Handel, Telemann, Rameau, François Couperin, Domenico Scarlatti, and Vivaldi.

            The Classical period saw the introduction of sonata form which dominates instrumental composition to the present day. With it came the development of the modern concerto, symphony, sonata, trio and quartet to a new peak of structural and expressive refinement. This period is characterized by a near-obsession with structural clarity.
            The Classical age was started by composers whose names are now largely forgotten such as Schobert and Honnauer, as well as more recognized respected names, such as Gluck and  Boccherini They were representative of a period which is variously described as rococo or galante, the former implying a gradual move away from the artifice of the High Baroque, the latter an entirely novel style based on symmetry and sensibility, which came to dominate the music of the latter half of the 18th century through two composers of extraordinary significance: Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

            <p>The next period in musical history had composers attempting to balance the expressive and the formal in music. There was a search for originality and individuality of expression. 
 
            The Romantic era was the golden age of the virtuoso, where difficult music would be performed with ease, and the most innocuous theme in a composition would be developed at great length for the enjoyment of the adoring audience. 
 
            The emotional range of music during this period was considerably widened, as was its harmonic vocabulary and the range and number of instruments which might be called upon to play it. Music often had a 'programme' or story-line attached to it, sometimes of a tragic or despairing nature, occasionally representing such natural phenomena as rivers or galloping horses.

            The six most popular composers of the age were: Berlioz, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Liszt and Verdi.

            <p>Composers of this period such as Brahms and Bruckner, shared a general tendency towards allowing their natural inspiration free rein, often pacing their compositions more in terms of their emotional content and dramatic continuity rather than organic structural growth. This time was  highlighted by the extraordinarily rapid appearance of the national schools. The eventual end of Romanticism came with the fragmentation of this basic style, composers joining 'schools' of composition, each with a style that was in vogue for a short period of time.
            </p>
        <h2><a name = "Post 'Great War' Years">Post 'Great War' Years (c.1920 - Present)</a></h2>
            <p>The period since the Great War is undoubtedly the most bewildering of all, as composers have pulled in various apparently contradictory and opposing directions. Typical of the dilemma during the inter-war years, for example, were the Austrians, Webern and Lehar, the former was experimenting with the highly compressed and advanced form known as 'serial structure', while simultaneously Lehar was still indulging in an operetta style which would not have seemed out of place over half a century beforehand.
            So diverse are the styles adopted throughout the greater part of the present century that only by experimentation can listeners discover for themselves whether certain composers are to their particular taste or not.
