        <h2><a id = "origin_of_the_term">Origin of the term</a></h2>
        The creation of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy, rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It is believed that Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army, by scat singing the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy later worked the "hip hop" cadence into a part of his stage performance, which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in "Rapper's Delight".
        <br>
        <br>
        Universal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa is credited with first using the term to describe the subculturein which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe the type of music. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The first use of the term in print was in The Village Voice, by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop. 

        <h2><a id = "1970">The 1970's</a></h2>
        Hip hop music was developed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African-American youth residing in the Bronx. Block parties incorporated DJs, who played popular genres of music, especially funk and soul music. Due to the positive reception, DJs began isolating the percussive breaks of popular songs. This technique was then common in Jamaican dub music, and was largely introduced into New York by immigrants from Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean, including DJ Kool Herc, who has been called a "founding father of hip hop".
        <br>
        <br>
        Because the percussive breaks in funk, soul and disco records were generally short, Herc and other DJs began using two turntables to extend the breaks. Herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the Jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting, a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music. On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was the DJ at his sister's back-to-school party. He extended the beat of a record by using two record players, isolating the percussion "breaks" by using a mixer to switch between the two records. Herc's experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or <a href="../../vocab/index.html#scratching">scratching</a>

        <h2> <a id = "1980">The 1980's</a></h2>
        The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles. New York City became a veritable laboratory for the creation of new hip hop sounds. 
        <h3> <a id = "New_school">New school hip hop</a></h3>
            The new school of hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J.
            <br>
            <br>
            The new school came predominately from New York City. It was initially characterized in form by drum machine-led minimalism, with influences from rock music, a hip hop "metal music for the 80's-a hard-edge ugly/beauty trance as desperate and stimulating as New York itself."
            <br>
            <br>
            It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco-influenced hip hop groups, whose pre-1984 music was characterized by novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and "party rhymes".
            <br>
            <br>
            By 1986, their releases began to establish the hip-hop album as a fixture of mainstream music. Hip hop music became commercially successful, as exemplified by the Beastie Boys' 1986 album Licensed to Ill, which was the first rap album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts.
        <h3><a id = "Golden_age">Golden age hip hop</a></h3>
            Hip hop's "golden age" (or "golden era") is a name given to a period in mainstream hip hop, produced between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s, which is characterized by its diversity, quality, innovation and influence. There were strong themes of Afrocentrism and political militancy in golden age hip hop lyrics. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The music was experimental and the sampling drew on eclectic sources. There was often a strong jazz influence in the music. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The artists and teams most often associated with this phrase are Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, Eric B. & Rakim, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr, Big Daddy Kane and the Jungle Brothers.
        <h3><a id = "Gangsta_and_West_Coast">Gangsta rap</a></h3>
            Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that reflects the violent lifestyles of inner-city American black youths.
            <br>
            <br>
            The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the national attention and controversy that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop.
            
        <h2><a id = "1990">The 1990's</a></h2>
        <h3><a id = "mainstream">Mainstream breakthrough</a></h3>
            In 1990, Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet was a significant success with music critics and consumers. The album played a key role in hip hop's mainstream emergence in 1990.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hip hop became a best-selling music genre in the mid-1990s and the top selling music genre by 1999 with 81 million CDs sold. By the end of the decade, hip hop was an integral part of popular music, and many American pop songs had hip hop components.
        <h3><a id = "East_vs_West">East vs West rivalry</a></h3>
        The East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry was a feud from 1991 to 1997 between artists and fans of the <a href = "../../vocab/index.html#eastcoasthiphop">East Coast hip hop</a> and <a href = "../../vocab/index.html#westcoasthiphop">West Coast hip hop </a> scenes in the United States, especially from 1994 to 1997.
            <br>
            <br>
            Focal points of the feud were East Coast-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G. and West Coast-based rapper Tupac Shakur, who were both fatally shot following drive-by shootings by unknown assailants in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
        <h2><a id = "2000">The 2000's</a></h2>
            The popularity of hip hop music continued through the 2000s.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alternative hip hop, which was introduced in the 1980s and then declined, resurged in the early 2000s with the rejuvenated interest in indie music by the general public.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hip hop music expanded beyond the US, often blending local styles with hip hop. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Starting in 2005, sales of hip hop music in the United States began to severely decline, leading Time magazine to question if mainstream hip-hop was "dying." 
            <br>
            <br>
            Some journalists say the music is just as popular as it ever was, but that fans have found other means to consume the music, such as illegally downloading music through P2P networks, instead of purchasing albums and singles from legitimate stores.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the late 2010s, many golden age hip hop artists announced their return to performing, including Eric B. & Rakim, Pete Rock & CL Smooth and A Tribe Called Quest
