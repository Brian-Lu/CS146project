    <h1>History of Latin Music</h1>
	<p>
		Latin music has influences from both Europe and Africa. 
		The African influences are the rhythm and style of the music. 
		The European influence on the music pertains to language, since most Latin music is sung in Spanish or Portuguese, which are languages introduced to the Americas by Europeans during colonization.

	<p>
		A key component of Latin music is a rhythmic pattern called <a href="../../vocab/index.html#clave">clave</a>. 
		This five-stroke pattern represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms. 
		Today, the presence of clave is a distinguishing factor of Latin music. 
		Latin music has also inspired numerous unqiue dance styles based on the rhythmic pattern of each Latin style. 
		Salsa is most popular Latin subgenre and has the closest evolutionary link with African music. 
		Some pioneers of salsa music include percussionist Tito Puente, Cuban singer Celia Cruz, and Venezuelan musician Oscar D'Leon.

		Although Latin music mostly comes from Latin America and the Caribbean, Latin Pop has also been popular in the United States since its debut in the 1990s. 
		Some contemporary artists with success in both North and South America are Shakira, J Balvin, and Enrique Iglesias.
