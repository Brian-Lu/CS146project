        While alternative rock did not get its name unitl the late 1970's, its roots were formed in the 1960's with the advent of proto-punk bands. Velvet Underground, MC5, Iggy and the Stooges and other bands set the stage for alternative bands as they created punk music that differed from the mainstream sounds of their era
